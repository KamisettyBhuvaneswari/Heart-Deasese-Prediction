The contents of this report primarily concentrate on predicting heart disease using machine learning technique. 
If the heart is not functioning properly, this may affect other parts of the body such as the brain,kidney, etc. Heart disease is a condition which affects the hearts functioning. 
This issue can be resolved by adopting machine learning techniques. The Dataset contains the major symptoms of heart disease which will be used for prediction by applying machine Learning models. 
The early diagnosis of heart disease plays a vital role in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high-risk patients and in turn reduce the complications.
